## Naomi Bid

Highly motivated full stack junior developer, with many years experience as a business owner and entrepreneur. Currently looking to join a company where I can utilize and further develop my coding and tech skills in a business focused work environment. My career goal is to take on a role in a software team which allows me to contribute and help the growth of the company.

## Skills and Experience

#### Entrepreneurship:

I ran a photography business for 8 years, trading in three outlets year round plus at seasonal events. I have learnt a range of business skills, from day to day operations to budgeting, accounts and generating revenue, as well as talking to customers and understanding their needs. I understand how to prioritise and focus on core business needs while growing a business. I take an approach which isn’t reckless but can minimize risk while considering growth. This means that sometimes the priority is not to run after a shiny new app or feature but to  focus on steady growth. I’ve done that in my own business growing from a single market stall to three and managing a team of staff to keep the business thriving. As I was able to keep a steady cash flow and strong growth I remained considerate of continual improvement and growth. I was able to develop creative solutions to visual merchandising, consider customer footfall when choosing new places to trade as well as seasonal fairs.

#### Client Facing:

In my business, it was important to create an authentic brand and a product that I could be really proud of. That is  really important when connecting with new customers and after eight years of trading I am confident dealing with people from all walks of life. Working on a product I believe in that also adds value to society is a big motivating factor for me.

#### Team Work:

I’ve managed teams, some of whom were family. When you work with your family, you have to be committed to get the best out of each of them because you can’t sack them! I have developed a communication style that allows me to be confident in expressing my own ideas while listening to others which has allowed me to build strong and motivated teams.

## Education and Tech Skills:

#### Makers Academy (October - December 2018)

In this intensive boot camp, I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience on: writing clean code, TDD,  OOP, Agile, SCRUM, XP Values.

As well as the following technologies:

* Ruby, Rspec, Sinatra, Capybara, Rails
* Javascript, Jasmine, JQuery, React, Cypress, Jest

And here some projects reflecting my work

|    Project Name    | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/NaomiBid/bank-tech-test)                                           |  An example using OOP principles and writing clean code           |
|[Gilded Rose](https://github.com/NaomiBid/Gilded-Rose-new-repository)                                                 | This course work exercise is an excellent example of refactoring messy legacy code into clean code that is easy to read and add to. This was achieved using OOP principles.            |
|[FizzBuzz in Python](https://github.com/NaomiBid/fizzbuzz-in-python)                                           |  This well known program was my introduction to learn Python (and a corresponding test suite: unittest). I was able to learn the syntax, prove to myself that I can pick up a new programming language and test suite in one morning, and program this using TDD.           |
